        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>This recipe is great for a cold or the sniffles. I don't know about you, but I barely like cooking on a day I'm feeling healthy, so I like to just use rotisserie chicken for this to make it a little easier. This way you don't need to wait as long for the chicken to cook - just shred it and heat.</p1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemongrass, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
            <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup ditalini pasta</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in garlic, ginger, lemongrass, thyme, and rosemary until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken stock, bay leaves, and 1 cup water. Add chicken and bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10-12 minutes. Remove chicken and shred, using two forks; set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir in pasta and cook until tender, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with chives, if desired.</li>
